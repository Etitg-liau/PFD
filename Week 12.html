<h2>Back to Work:</h2>
<p>For week 12, I still had my Github problems.
    Still, we decided to split the work according to the below.<br>

    I actually wanted to work on the OpenCV to compare images since I already started on it, but since Reginald wanted to do it,
    I just gave him his role and told him to ask us if he needs any help.
    
    I spent the rest of the day trying to make sure my github works.
