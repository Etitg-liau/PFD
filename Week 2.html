    <p>For week 2, we reviewed the project and we decided to assign roles for each of our 4 members. We also added an inception deck, and discussed about the Elevator Pitch and Product Box in
       Our main objective is to improve attendance taking by enhancing security and efficiency. We also decided on the product name which is FRATS,Facial Recognition Attendance Taking System,
       and our slogan is Better implementation of Artificial Intelligence to everyday Life for all. I also started working on my sqlite database where I installed sqlite3 on my computer and
       tinkered with it a little. The roles are as follows:
       - OpenCV and Facial Recognition: Reginald
       - Database: Peter
       - Website Design FrontEnd: Jai
       - Website backend: Qi Yang 

       Besides doing the project, I learnt 5 ways of design thinking: Emphatize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. Emphatizing is the understanding of the needs, desires, and challenges of the users or customers by putting yourself in their shoes.
       Design is defining the problem statement and identifying the goals and objectives of the design project. It is used by defining the core problem or challenge. Ideate is generating a wide range of ideas and potential solutions to address the defined problem
       like BrainStorming. Prototyping is the process of creating a tangible representation of the ideas generated during the ideation phase. Lastly, testing where designers collect feedback and assess the prototypes with the intended users.
       This feedback provides valuable insights for designers to assess the effectiveness of their solutions in meeting user needs and identify areas that require improvement.
