<h2>Back to Work:</h2>
<p>I debugged the frontend problems that Jai faced and connected the attendance portion to the backend part of the code.
    <br>I also fixed the issue where some test data on Qiyangs part does not match with the frontend portion.<br>
    Here comes the problem:<br>
    Reginald has not finished his OpenCV portion. We were going to be in deep trouble if he did not fix it.<br>
    However, Qiyang and I cannot do anything as we already reminded Reginald a couple of times.
