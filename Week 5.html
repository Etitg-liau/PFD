<h2>Hackaton:</h2>
<p>For week 5, I was pretty much done with my parts of the database. I decided to instead help my teammates to debug wherever necessary.
    <br>
    <br>
    Summary of Work:
    <br>
    Day 1
    <br>
    I have reupdated the OpenCV file to help Reginald, and fixed some bugs in my database. I also discussed
    with Qiyang how the Flask will be able to connect to the database.<br>
    <br>
    Day 2
    <br>
    I also helped add more test cases so Qi Yang can test and see everything is working. I helped Jai to also
    fix some bugs of his code in his case. I helped create a backup OpenCV script for Reginald on my own accord 
    since he told us he was still fixing bugs and didnt share his code with me. I also added an additional database
    for Jai's frontend part that QiYang suggested so the web application will look more like a proper website.
    I decided to start editing the slides too.<br>
    <br>
    Day 3
    <br>
    It was at this moment that I realised that Reginald have not finished making the comparating images part of OpenCV. 
    Earlier, we misunderstood when he said he will take charge of all the openCV parts. 
    However, it is too late to add anything and we had to do our presentation.<br>
