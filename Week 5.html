<p>For week 5, I have reupdated the opencv file to help Reginald, and fixed some bugs in my database.
    On day 2, I also helped add more test cases so Qi Yang can test and see everything is working. Other than that,
    I tried helping my teammates if they needed since I finished implementing my database. It was at this moment that I 
    realised that Reginald have not finished making the comparating images part of OpenCV. Earlier, we misunderstood when
    he said he will take charge of all the openCV parts. However, it is too late to add anything and we had to do our presentation.
