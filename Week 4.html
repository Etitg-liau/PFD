</div><u><h2>Week 4</h2></u>
<h2>Update:</h2>
<p>For week 4, I have finished the sqlite database. I coordinated with QiYang to get both our parts working and clarified some of his
    questions about the database.
   I have also created a python script to get download the image from the database and fixed some minor issues with the code.
    I also checked up on my teammates progress and it looks nearly finished. Jai had produced the front end, QiYang has helped with
    fixing bugs and creating the python script to connect sqlite database to the online website using flask, reginald has
    reassured us that he is nearly finished with openCV part.
</p>
