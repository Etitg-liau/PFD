<h2>Back to Work:</h2>
<p>At 8:41pm on the day of submission, Reginald finally pushed the code. Me and Qiyang were stumped.
    In the end, I rushed through the backend and only managed to make it work for one of the users.
    My github then encountered an error again. I pushed my changes as soon as I saw the error and thankfully
    managed to complete some parts of the backend.
    Qiyang used his computer to do the presentation so I edited my portion of the code on his End and managed
    to make it work.<br>

    Reflection:<br>
    I was shocked by how late Reginald pushed the code, he could have asked for help from us when debugging to make it faster.
    Qiyang and I couldnt finish our parts on time because of it. I dont want to blame Reginald since he did put in effort when we are not looking,
    but we couldnt keep track of his parts of the work. And I discussed with Shane (from Girls group) and she told me openCV can be done within 1 week.<br>
    I really do not know what to feel about it. However, I am still glad that my team managed to finish our work and do our parts.
