    <u><h2>Week 8</h2></u>
    <p>For week 8, I reflected on what I needed to do as the team leader. I decided to self learn and <br>
        catch up on OpenCV for comparing Images. I feel like our communication is not good enough, so we need<br>
        to work on it. As such, I compiled some updates we can do to make our project better moving forward.
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides this, I was in Taiwan. And when I tried using Visual Studio to add my ideas and pushed to GitHub,<br>
        my whole GitHub gave a huge error and my changes got reverted.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was then I realized GitHub was censored in China and I was using China's Telco to do my work.<br>
        Well, I was in deep trouble and told my groupmates about it.
