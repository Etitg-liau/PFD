    <u><h2>Week 8</h2></u>
    <p>For week 8, I reflected on what I needed to do as the team leader. I decided to self learn and <br>
        catch up on OpenCV for comparing Images. I feel like our communication is not good enough, so we need<br>
        to work on it. As such, I compiled some updates we can do to make our project better moving forward.
