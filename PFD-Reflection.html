    <u><h2>Week 1</h2></u>
    <p>For week 1, I was very impressed with Mr Low's experience in Engineering and Programming where he told us about his time in ST Engineering creating the weapons and 
        coding the Moovita with Go in just 3 days. Apart from his flexing, I thought of the problem statement, How would the data from some of these examples be collected, 
        collated, stored, retrieved, analyzed and some value be derived for use by the industry? and came up with a security card with OpenCV. After meeting my team, we collated 
        our ideas and agreed on changing our project idea to using OpenCV to connect to a camera for facial recognition to connect to a SQLite database to authenticate people.
