<h2>Back to Work:</h2>
<p>Week 13, my Github is not yet fixed. <br>In this case, I decided to set up a Google Coral Board so that my Team
    can use it for OpenCV. Source: https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/get-started/#requirements<br>

    It helps speed up the whole processing power so OpenCV can run faster.<br>
    Besides that, I had an idea from Week 8 that I wanted to do before my Github ran into the error.<br>

    I wanted to implement an ID card for each registered member in the company.
    It should look like the below:<br>
    <img src="Week13.png">
    <br>
    <img src="Week13-2.png">
    <h2>The code for the ID Card</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Although I managed to get the images and code, it was saved previously. So I tasked Jai to help me out since he did the front end.</p><br>
    <p>I also help Qiyang and Jai solve bugs on their side as well, and created a LinkedIn page for our "company"</p>
