<h2>Tech Assessment:</h2>
<p>My Github has another error again. Even though, I can still show the tech assessment.

    <h2>Reflection:</h2>
    As I did the tech assessment, I felt the questions were indeed tricky and tough even though it says easy as the difficulty level.<br>
    Using my own knowledge about programming got me a 50 and 56 for ASP.NET and CSS. I would admit that it may be an accurate representation<br>
    since I actually did not touch ASP.NET for the whole of this semester and my designing was not that great.<br>
    However, I am glad that I did well for HTML and bootstrap to my surprise.<br>
    Overall, I think I did quite well for full stack development, but I might need to work on my C# and css. Additionally, I really need to study up about Github.<br>
    It was really the main problem in the whole of PFD Module. I am glad I know where my knowledge stands at in Full-Stack.<br>
