<h2>Back to Work:</h2>
<p>Finally my Github worked. I would like to thank Zhi Wei for helping me and Mr Ben for suggesting some solutions.<br> Apparently, I had to install cmake and reinstall my python and pip files.
    I also brought the google dev board to School this time for Reginald to test OpenCV but it did not work.<br> I was dissapointed in my time of seting up the dev board and tried to reconfigure it when I reach home.
    I checked up with my teammates on their progress.<br>
    Jai had more bugs to solve
    Me and QiYang were waiting for Reginalds OpenCV.

    I decided to help Jai solve the issues of dissapearing images in Frontend.<br>
    I asked Reginald if he needed help, he just said he needed to debug the code and went off to start solving his code.<br>
    QiYang was hesitant if we could finish on time since our parts needed OpenCV to work.<br>
    Qiyang needs to upload the OpenCV comparison to the database.<br>
    I need to update the frontend employees timing by accessing Qiyangs database.
